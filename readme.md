# Initial set up for Invo interview exercise

### To run:
  - Using node: `npm install && node app.js` (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
  - Using python: `cd client && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337`
  - Visit [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

### Goals:
  - Our page needs a title of 'Eagle Ordinary'
  - Prevent the header from overlapping the rest of the content
  - Center the header title
  - Make the characters stand side by side
  - Move the legend to the right side of the screen
  - When hovering over character names in the legend, the characters should animate. Can you fix the JavaScript?
  - Can you refactor the JavaScript to be cleaner / more efficient?
  - The images display pretty poorly right now. They flash when loading and jump between sizes. How can we improve that?
  - Can you refactor this all to use the API for character names?
